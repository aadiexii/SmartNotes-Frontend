# 📝 Smart Notes – Frontend Practice

This project is a frontend-only implementation of the **Smart Notes** UI design from the Figma Community. It was built to sharpen my frontend skills using React and CSS.

## 🎯 Purpose

This is a **practice project** focused on replicating a clean and modern UI from this Figma design:

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **CSS** 

## 🖼️ Design Reference

The entire layout and component structure are based on the Smart Notes Figma file created by [@Salman](https://www.figma.com/@salmanraza1).

## 🚧 Project Status

UI replication is in progress. No backend or note functionality is included — this is strictly for **frontend development practice**.
